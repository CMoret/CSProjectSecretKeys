SecretKeys is a key logger program that enables you to record a user's keystrokes, potentially allowing an attacker to obtain the information they desire. 

The program begins by importing the required libraries to enable 'keyboard' from 'pynput.' 

An 'on_press' function is defined and executed when a key is pressed on the keyboard.

A keyboard listener is used to capture and handle the keystrokes. 

The program terminates when the Escape key is pressed.

(This message in the terminal is basically stating, I need to update my security settings on my operating system to grant accessibility access for program to run).
